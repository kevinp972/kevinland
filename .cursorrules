## Stack
- React
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- shadcn/ui

## Misc
- Use `npx shadcn@latest add *` to add components from shadcn/ui

## Folder Structure (under `src/`)
- `components/` â€“ Reusable UI elements
- `pages/` â€“ Route-level pages (Home, Projects, etc.)
- `app/` â€“ App Router structure
- `assets/` â€“ Images, fonts, etc.
- `styles/` â€“ Tailwind, global CSS, or styled-components
- `lib/` â€“ Utilities, helpers, API functions

ðŸ“Œ **Ask before creating new top-level folders**. Do not create them directly.

## Site Structure
This is a personal website with the following subpages:
- Home (main landing)
- About
- Projects
- Music Performances
- Photo Gallery

We might add more later, but this is the structure for now.

ðŸ‘‰ Set up routing for all pages, but **only focus on building the Home page** for now. Other pages should remain blank placeholders until later.

## Component Guidelines
- Split components over 100 lines into smaller parts.
- Extract a component if it manages its own state or logic.

## Coding Rules
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any` unless absolutely necessary)
- Avoid unnecessary state â€“ only use `useState` when needed
- Donâ€™t abstract early â€“ generalize only after repeating a pattern
- Donâ€™t mix styling strategies (e.g., Tailwind + raw CSS + styled-components)
- Avoid deep prop drilling â€“ lift state or use context if needed
